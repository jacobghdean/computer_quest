# computer_quest

This project uses Python 3.9 with the [Pygame library](https://www.pygame.org) and was created in a group of five which I led.

## Storyline

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen an unfortunate shortage in computer chips, graphics cards, gaming consoles, and other PC components.
This is due to the extreme cost and time it takes to both produce these components and to build new plants, as well as due to resellers buying up all the stock and scalping consumers.
Your goal is to build a brand new gaming PC, which will be a big challenge considering these circumstances.
You will spawn at the entrance of a massive computer shop and you need to purchase the components with which you will build your PC.
However, to discourage bulk buying, there is a 5 minute time limit inside the shop.
If you have not successfully bought your items at the checkout by this time, you will be booted out of the shop empty handed.
And as you can imagine, you are also not the only one shopping for these scarce components.
You will encounter many enemies on your journey throughout the shop who will try to beat you up and grab the components in your basket.
Good luck with your shopping, and happy PC building!
